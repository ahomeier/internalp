\section{GRB models}
Most GRB analyises within IceCube use information from observed GRBs to look
for neutrino clusters in time and space correlation with the detected GRBs.
This strategy has the obvious advantague of reducing the neutrino background to
achieve higher significance per GRB observation. However, due to the limited
Field of View of the satelites there will be many GRBs that stay undetected.
Furthermore, one is biased by the detection sensitivity of the satelites.

In this analysis, a GRB population is assumed based on theoretical work and
extrapolation based on data from Swift and other satelites to calculate their
expected signal in IceCube.
The different population models under consideration are discussed in this
chapter.

The main analysis has been done based on the luminosity function and GRB rate
density calculated by Wanderman and Piran (reference ???). 

The other models presented here were considered to examine the dependency on
the assumed model.

\subsection{Long low luminosity GRBs}
In recent years, IceCube has started to rule out the first optimistic GRB
neutrino emission models leading to new ideas as to possible neutrino emitters.
It has been proposed (reference ???) that a high number of very low
luminosity GRBs exists that are difficult to detect in $\gamma$-rays but could
produce most of the neutrinos expected from GRBs. In principle, the follow-up
analysis based on IceCube triggers can be an approach to examine these objects.
Thus they are discussed here briefly for completeness sake.

Unfortunately, these low luminosity GRBs are predicted to have a prompt
emission phase in the range of $10^3$ s. The follow-up program surpresses
background by allowing a maximal time difference of 100s between two events
reducing the sensitivity to very long GRBs at the same time. Therefore, they
have not been examined yet within this analysis.
