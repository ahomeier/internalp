\section{GRB models}
\label{sec:GRB_models}
Most GRB analysis within IceCube use information from observed GRBs to look
for neutrino clusters in time and space correlation with the detected GRBs.
This strategy has the obvious advantage of reducing the neutrino background to
achieve higher significance per GRB observation. However, due to the limited
Field of View of the satellites there will be many GRBs that stay undetected.
Furthermore, one is biased by the detection sensitivity of the satellites.

In this analysis, a GRB population is assumed based on theoretical work and
extrapolation based on data from Swift and other satellites. The redshift and
luminosity functions are extracted.
The neutrino luminosity function is assumed to have the same shape and is
shifted in energy by an efficiency factor $\epsilon$ (see section ???).
%  to calculate their
% expected signal in IceCube.
The different population models under consideration are discussed in this
chapter.

The main analysis has been done based on the luminosity function and GRB rate
density calculated by Wanderman and Piran (\ref{ssec:WP}). 
The other models presented here were considered to examine the dependency on
the assumed model.

\subsection{Cosmology}
The following cosmological definitions are used in the further calculations.

\textbf{Differential co-moving shell volume} 
\begin{equation}
dV = 4 \pi D_H \frac{(1+z)^2D_a^2(z)}{K(z)}dz
\end{equation}
\textbf{Hubble distance}
\begin{equation}
 D_H = \frac{c}{H_0} = 3000 h^{-1}\text{Mpc}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Angular distance}
\begin{equation}
 D_a(z) = (1+z)^{-2} D_l(z)
\end{equation}
\textbf{Parameters} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item  $K(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1 + z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}$
 \item $h=0.7$
 \item $\Omega_m = 0.3$
 \item $\Omega_\Lambda$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long low luminosity GRBs}
In recent years, IceCube has started to rule out the first optimistic GRB
neutrino emission models leading to new ideas as to possible neutrino emitters.
It has been proposed (reference ???) that a high number of very low
luminosity GRBs exists that are difficult to detect in $\gamma$-rays but could
produce most of the neutrinos expected from GRBs. In principle, the follow-up
analysis based on IceCube triggers can be an approach to examine these objects.
Thus they are mentioned here briefly for completeness sake. 

Unfortunately, these low luminosity GRBs are predicted to have a prompt
emission phase in the range of $10^3$ s. The follow-up program suppresses
background by allowing a maximal time difference of 100s between two events
reducing the sensitivity to very long GRBs at the same time. Therefore, they
have not been examined yet within this analysis but mentioned for the 
interested reader.

\subsection{Supernovae}
The models presented described GRB population models. However, the OFU is 
sensitive to all short ($O(10 \text{ s})$) transient neutrino sources. E.g. the 
simulation can be used to examine a population of core collapse SN as well. 
%Nora s work

jet production jets stuck within the explosion (Ando and Beacom). the exact 
mechanism is not important here, as we assume that it will reproduce the HESE 
spectrum.

SN follow star formation rate. our distribution close enough (first order)

luminosity function for GRBs broad spanning several order of magnitudes. less 
fluctuations for SN. gaussian curve in log10 space with a width of 0.4 orders 
of magnitudes corresponding to a width of one astronomical magnitude.
