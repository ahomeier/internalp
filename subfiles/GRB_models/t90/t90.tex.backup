\subsection{T90}
Ninety percent of the detectable $\gamma$-ray flux is received between a
time intervall called $t_{90}$. Reference (???) lists values for most GRBs.
They are displayed in figure \ref{fig:t90earth}. 

In the GRB Toy Monte Carlo $t_{90}$ values will be drawn at source ($S$) to
calculate the total energy output. It will be folded with the drawn redshift to
calculate the $t_{90}$ pervieved at earth ($E$).
\begin{equation}
 t_{90, E} = t_{90, S} \cdot \left( 1 + z \right)
\end{equation}


what is t90
from GRB table (source?)
fold with redshift
result function in table
what about HC?
