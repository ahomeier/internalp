\section{GRB models}
\label{sec:GRB_models}
Most GRB analysis within IceCube use information from observed GRBs to look
for neutrino clusters in time and space correlated to the detected GRBs.
This strategy has the obvious advantage of reducing the neutrino background to
achieve higher significance per GRB observation. However, due to the limited
Field of View of the satellites there will be many GRBs that stay undetected.
Furthermore, one is biased by the detection sensitivity of the satellites.

In this analysis, a GRB population is assumed based on theoretical work and
extrapolation based on data from Swift and other satellites. The redshift and
luminosity functions are extracted.
The neutrino luminosity function is assumed to have the same shape and is
shifted in energy by an efficiency factor $\epsilon$ (see section 
\ref{sec:norm2HESE}).

The different population models under consideration are discussed in this
chapter.

The main analysis has been done based on the luminosity function and GRB rate
density calculated by Wanderman and Piran (\ref{ssec:WP}). 
The other models presented here were considered to examine the dependency on
the assumed model.

\subsection{Cosmology}
The following cosmological definitions are used in the calculations of the 
following chapters.

\textbf{Differential co-moving shell volume} 
\begin{equation}
dV = 4 \pi D_H \frac{(1+z)^2D_a^2(z)}{K(z)}dz
\end{equation}
\textbf{Hubble distance}
\begin{equation}
 D_H = \frac{c}{H_0} = 3000 h^{-1}\text{Mpc}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Angular distance}
\begin{equation}
 D_a(z) = (1+z)^{-2} D_l(z)
\end{equation}
\textbf{Parameters} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item  $K(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1 + z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}$
 \item $h=0.7$
 \item $\Omega_m = 0.3$
 \item $\Omega_\Lambda$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long low luminosity GRBs}
In recent years, IceCube has started to rule out the first optimistic GRB
neutrino emission models leading to new ideas as to possible neutrino emitters.
It has been proposed \cite{lowlumgrbs} that a high number of very low
luminosity GRBs exists that are difficult to detect in $\gamma$-rays, but could
produce most of the neutrinos expected from GRBs. In principle, the follow-up
analysis based on IceCube triggers can be an approach to examine these objects.
Thus, they are mentioned here briefly for the sake of completeness and future 
possible Follow-Up extensions. 

Unfortunately, these low luminosity GRBs are predicted to have a prompt
emission phase in the range of $10^3$ s. The follow-up program suppresses
background by allowing a maximal time difference of 100s between two events
reducing the sensitivity to very long GRBs at the same time. Therefore, they
have not been examined yet within this analysis but mentioned for the 
interested reader.

\subsection{Supernovae}
The models presented described GRB population models. However, the Optical 
Follow-Up is sensitive to all short ($O(10 \text{ s})$) transient neutrino 
sources. E.g. the simulation can be used to examine a population of core 
collapse Supernovae (SNe) as well. A model predicting high energy neutrinos 
from SNe \cite{AB} assumes a jet production withing the SN similar to the jets 
of 
the GRB fireball model. Due to the lack of energy, they do not penetrate the 
stellar envelope and are therefore invisible to the telescopes 
observing the electromagnetic signal. In contrast, neutrinos would escape the 
SN and could possibly be detected within IceCube. The exact mechanism and 
resulting predicted spectrum is not important for this analysis as we assume a 
population of sources and attribute to them a spectrum that reproduces the 
measured HESE flux.
%Nora s work

SNe follow the star formation rate which, in first order, can be approximated 
by the Wanderman Piran redshift distribution. However, the luminosity function 
differs quite a bit by not showing the big variations in luminosity that are 
observed for GRBs. Instead, the luminosity function is assumed to follow a 
Gaussian curve in logarithmic space with a width of 0.4 orders of magnitudes 
corresponding to a width of one astronomical magnitude. A comparison to the WP 
luminosity function is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lum_SN}. The mean luminosity is 
chosen at random and will be later adjusted to create the expected neutrino 
flux.
