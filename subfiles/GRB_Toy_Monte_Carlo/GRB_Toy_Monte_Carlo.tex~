\section{GRB Toy Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:GRBTMC}
The previous chapters have laid the ground work on which the GRB Population Toy
Monte Carlo is built. This chapter describes how GRBs are being drawn according
to the models described in section ??? and how the neutrino signal expectation
within IceCube is calculated. 

What about GRB counting and so on?

test statistic? next chapter?

\subsection{GRB Spectra}
\label{sec:GRBSpectra}
The astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube can be described by various
spectra depending on the data and conditions set for the fit. This
analysis examines three different scenarios.

The first two scenarios are based on global fits not only to the HESE events but
to other datasets as well. Once a fit with a cut-off was chosen and once the
index of the power law was free. The third fit is exclusevly based on the HESE
data with a free index:

{\bf Global fit: cut-off}
\begin{equation}
 E^2 \Phi = 0.9 \cdot 10^{-8} \cdot \text{exp}\left(-\frac{E}{2.8 \text{ PeV}}
\right) \text{GeV s}^{-1} \text{ sr}^{-1} \text{ cm}^{-2}
\end{equation}
{\bf Global fit: free index}
\begin{equation}
 E^2 \Phi = 2.24 \cdot 10^{-8} \left(\frac{E}{100 \text{ PeV}} \right)^{-0.7}
\cdot \text{exp}\left(-\frac{E}{2.8 \text{ PeV}}
\right) \text{GeV s}^{-1} \text{ sr}^{-1} \text{ cm}^{-2}
\end{equation}
{\bf HESE fit: free index}
\begin{equation}
 E^2 \Phi = 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8} \left(\frac{E}{100 \text{ PeV}} \right)^{-0.3}
\cdot \text{exp}\left(-\frac{E}{2.8 \text{ PeV}}
\right) \text{GeV s}^{-1} \text{ sr}^{-1} \text{ cm}^{-2}
\end{equation}

For the purpose of this analysis these spectra are assumed to be created by
GRBs or other examined transient sources and as such a superposition of the
individual GRB spectra. They are given the same shape.
Generally, the flux follows the following formula which will be used in the
following chapters for general calculations.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:HESEflux_gen}
 \Phi = \Phi_0 E^{-\gamma} \text{exp} \left(-\frac{E}{\hat{E}_{cut}} \right)
\end{equation}
The break energy $\hat{E}_{cut}$ is set to be a physics parameter that is the
same for all GRBs. In case of scenario 1 it has to be optimized to reproduce
the cutoff at earth of 2.8 PeV as good as possible. In the other two cases it
is set to $10^{20}$ GeV and doesn't have any impact within the further analysis.
