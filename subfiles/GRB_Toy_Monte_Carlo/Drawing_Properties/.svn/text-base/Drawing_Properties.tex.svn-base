\subsection{Drawing GRB properties}
\label{sec:drawnProp}
This section describes how properties such as the luminosity and the redshift
are drawn according to their distribution ($f1$) specified in section
\ref{sec:GRB_models}. 

The function determines the maximum $f_{max}$ and minimum $f_{min}$ of $f1$
within a range in which a parameter $p$ is to be drawn. The range is specified
by the user. 

In the next step it randomly throws a value $p1$ for $p$ within the specified
range and a random value $f_{random}$ between $f_{min}$ and $f_{max}$. Is
$f_{random} <= f(p1)$ fullfilled, then p1 is returned as a value for $p$
according to the distribution $f1$. Otherwise the step is repeated until the
condition is met.

The following parameters are drawn:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Peak luminosity $L_\text{Peak}$
 \item Redshift $z$
 \item Zenith angle $\theta$ (uniform in cos($\theta$))
 \item Azimuth angle $\phi$ (uniform)
 \item $t_{90, S}$
\end{itemize}
