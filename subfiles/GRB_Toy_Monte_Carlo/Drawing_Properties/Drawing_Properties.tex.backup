\subsection{Drawing GRB properties}
This section describes how properties such as the luminosity and the redshift
are drawn according to their distribution specified in section
\ref{sec:GRB_models}. The 

range 
determine max and min
draws properties randomly in range
draws randomly in y range
calculate y at property
if random y smaller than y calc -> return property otherwise repeat.
