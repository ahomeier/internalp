\subsection{Detection Probabilities}
At this stage, the drawing of GRB properties according to specified functions
and the subsequent derivation and calculation of the signal expectation in
IceCube has been explained. However, the Optical (and X-ray) Follow-Up does not
trigger on singlets but on multiplets fulfilling several criteria.

Multiplets are a number of neutrinos that arrive within 100 s and 3.5 degrees
of each other (chapter ???). A test statistic was implemented to select the
most signal like doublets (chapter ???) to trigger Swift. Once triggered there
is a chance that a source will not be within the FoV of the XRT. 

\subsubsection{Doublet Probabilities}
\paragraph{P$_{\Delta t}$}$\;$\\
% \\
%  \Rightarrow \tau &= \frac{-t_{90}}{\text{ln}(0.1)}
P$_{\Delta t}$ is the probability that two neutrinos arrive within
100 seconds, the time window
specified in the doublet search. 
It falls exponentially with time if the lightcurve is assumed to be fast rising
with an exponential decay (FRED)
\begin{equation}
 P(\Delta t) = 1 - e^{\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau} \right)}
\end{equation}
in which $\tau$ can be determined according to equation \ref{eq:ToyMC_tau} given
the $t_{90}$ drawn according to \ref{eq:t90dist} and converted in agreement
with \ref{eq:t90earth}. For the Optical Follow-Up
$\Delta t_{max} =100 \text{ s}$ is currently set. 

The effects of different time
windows could be examined by choosing different values. However, this is not
the focus of this work.



\paragraph{P$_{3.5^\circ}$}$\;$\\
The second requirement for each neutrino pair is that they arrive with a
maximum angular separation of 3.5 degrees. To calculate the probability 
P$_{3.5^\circ}$ of this happening for a given GRB, nugen events need to be
selected from within the zenith band (chapter \ref{sec:zenith_bands}) and
shifted to the GRB direction (chapter \ref{sec:shift2source}). Each remaining
event is paired with all other events, and the angular differences of the
shifted reconstructed directions are determined. The probability is then the
ratio between the sum of the weight products (eq. \ref{eqn:Nexp_wZB_wEps}) of
all event pairs passing the $3.5^\circ$ cut and all pairs
\begin{equation}
 P_{3.5^\circ} = \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j | \Delta \Psi(i, j)
\leq
3.5^{\circ}}{\sum_i \sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j}
\end{equation}
This procedure takes a lot of computational power. However it is the
same for all GRBs coming from the exact same zenith angle as the same nugen
events will be considered. 


Therefore, about ten thousand GRBs are drawn for each OFU cut setting and HESE
spectra, the probability calculated and the result is used to parametrize the
probability as a function of the GRB's zenith angle
$P_{3.5^\circ}(\theta_\text{GRB})$. The parameterization is then used to
simulate GRBs in greater numbers.

\paragraph{P$_\text{Doublet}$}$\;$\\
The probability that two neutrinos form a doublet that triggers OFU is then
\begin{equation}
 P_\text{Doublet} = P_{\Delta t} \cdot P_{3.5^\circ}
\end{equation}



\paragraph{P$_{\text{llh}}$}$\;$\\
On average the doublet selection based on time and direction leads to about 50 -
60
doublets per year (depending on season) while only nine alerts can be sent to
the Swift telescope. The
selection of the most signal like doublets is based on the test statistic
(chapter ???)
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
    \lambda = -2 \ln \mathcal{L} &= \frac{\Delta\Psi^2}{\sigma_q^2} + 2 \ln(2
\pi \sigma_q^2) \\
                              &- 2 \ln\left( 1 -
e^{\frac{-\theta_A^2}{2\sigma_w^2}}\right) 
                              + 2 \ln\left( \frac{\Delta T}{\unit[100]{s}}
\right)
    \end{split}
  \label{eq:alert-llh}
\end{align}
where the time between the neutrinos in the multiplet is denoted as $\Delta T$
and their angular separation as $\Delta\Psi$. $\sigma_q^2 = \sigma_1^2 +
\sigma_2^2$ and $\sigma_w^2 = \left(1/\sigma_1^2 + 1/\sigma_2^2\right)^{-1}$
with $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the uncertainties on the directional
reconstruction of the two neutrino events.
$\theta_A$ corresponds to the (circularized) angular radius of the field
of view (FoV) of the follow-up telescope (set to $0.5^\circ$ for Swift). This
test statistic is calculated for all event pairs that pass the condition of
being reconstructed within $3.5^\circ$. The time difference is randomly drawn
with $\Delta T \in [0, 100]$ s and weighted according to an exponential decay
(Eq. \ref{eq:lum_vs_time}) introducing a dependency on $t_{90}$
(Eq. \ref{eq:ToyMC_tau}).

% \end{table}


The Toy Monte Carlo requires a cut value $\lambda_\text{cut}$ on the
test statistic as input.
% (table \ref{tab:llh cut values}) 
The probability that
a GRB doublet will pass the cut is determined by taking the ratio of the sum of
weight
products from events passing the cut and the sum of all doublets passed to this
function.
\begin{equation}
 P_\text{llh} = \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j \; | \; \lambda(i, j)
\leq \lambda_\text{cut} \; | \; \Delta \Psi(i, j) \leq 3.5^{\circ}}{\sum_i
\sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j \; | \; \Delta \Psi(i, j) \leq 3.5^{\circ}}
\end{equation}

 \captionsetup{width=.9\textwidth}

and parametrized values is shown. Most GRBs fall within 5\% derivation while
some outliers differ up to 12\%.\\}
 \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The parameterization of $P_\text{llh}$ is more complicated than
$P_{3.5^\circ}$. The test statistic depends not only on properties of simulated
neutrino events and thus the zenith angle but on the time window between two
neutrinos and thus $t_{90}$. Therefore, the data is split into ??? cosinus bin
and the probability is fitted against the logarithm of the drawn $t_{90}$ (Eq.
\ref{eq:t90dist} and \ref{eq:t90earth}) value. An example is shown in figure
\ref{fig:Pllhparam}. The quality of the parameterization for all cosinus bins is
tested using a second dataset and forming a histogram of the ratio between the
simulated probability and the parametrized one. Most events are within 5\%
derivation however some differ up to 12\%. The outlier's effects should average
out by simulating a great number of GRBs (usually 5 million per dataset).

%proof that outliers average out???
%where do they lie??? which GRBs???


\paragraph{P$_\text{onS}$}$\;$\\
The Optical Follow-Up program calculates the weighted mean direction from both
events using the Cramer Rao error as weights. For a source to be detectable
with Swift this
direction must be within 0.5 degrees of the true source direction. The
probability $P_\text{onS}$ for two events to point back to the source well
enough is given by
the ratio of the sum over the event weight products fulfilling the condition
and the sum over all event weight products:
\begin{equation}
P_\text{onS} = \frac{\sum_i \sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j |
\Psi_{\text{weighted mean}}(i, j) - \Psi_{GRB} \leq 0.5^{\circ} \; | \;
\lambda(i, j)
\leq \lambda_\text{cut} \; | \; \Delta \Psi(i, j) \leq 3.5^{\circ}}{\sum_i
\sum_{j=i+1} w_i \cdot w_j \; | \; \lambda(i, j)
\leq \lambda_\text{cut} \; | \; \Delta \Psi(i, j) \leq 3.5^{\circ}} 
\end{equation}

It is parametrized with the same methods as $P_\text{llh}$.

\subsubsection{Probability to Detect a GRB}
In the previous sections the probabilities to have an XFU trigger were
explained. They are calculated assuming the existence of two detected
neutrinos. However, the number of expected neutrinos within IceCube (Eq.
\ref{eqn:Nexp_wZB_wEpsStar}) can be smaller or larger. The final probability
to detect a GRB with the Optical Follow-Up considers the number of possible
doublets - and thus possible higher multiplets. These considerations are
described in this chapter.

% To detect a GRB in neutrinos we do not only need two or more detected neutrinos
% in IceCube, but also the cuts of the Follow-up Programm have to be fullfilled.
% One criterium is that given the case two neutrinos are detected the difference
% between their reconstructed directions has to be smaller than 3.5$^\circ$. In
% Figure \ref{fig:skymap_grb} the reconstructed directions are shown for one
% example.
% 
% 
% \begin{figure}

%     \caption{\label{fig:skymap_grb}For this Figure all true neutrino directions
% have been shifted onto the GRB (red star) and the reconstructed neutrino
% directions are shown. In the lefthand Figure one sees that only few neutrinos
% are far off the GRB, while the righthand Figure provides a more detailed view.}
% \end{figure}
% 
% The most direct way to obtain the probability that the angular criterium is
% fullfilled is to look up for every possible combination of two neutrinos,
% whether they are close enough or not. By multiplying and adding up the
% Oneweights of those neutrino pair, we take into account the probability that
% those two neutrinos are detected.
% 
% However this method is very time consuming and we therefore tried to find a way
% to parametrize the probability P3p5.
